# decimal2binary
Examples of converting a decimal number to its binary representation in various  languages.

The two methods demonstrated here are
1.  Using a bit mask to expose each bit individually in turn, producing the binary value.
2.  Dividing the value by 2 and capturing the remainder, generating a reversed list of
the binary digits. Returning this list, first reversed, produces the binary value.
